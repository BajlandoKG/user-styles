An important consideration when writing user styles is that you need your style rules to override any existing rules for the same elements. Which rule wins when two apply to the same property of the same element is determined by [CSS cascade rules](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-CSS2-20110607/cascade.html#cascading-order).

It's recommended that all your declarations include the !important keyword. This will give your rules the best chance of applying without additional changes. An example of !important:

```css
a {
	text-decoration: none !important;
}
```

In Stylish for Firefox and other Mozilla software, user styles are given the origin "user agent". This means that any !important declarations will beat all author declarations (styles the page has defined), !important or not.

In Stylish for Chrome and in Greasemonkey styles generated by userstyles.org, user styles are given the origin "author", which is the same origin as styles the page has defined. This means they do not automatically beat the page's styles (though !important will beat non-!important).

When two rules have the same origin and !importance, the one with the highest [specificity](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-CSS2-20110607/cascade.html#specificity) wins. You can artificially increase your specificity by writing longer selectors. For example, given the markup:

```html
<div id="foo">
	<span id="bar">text</span>
</div>
```

and the site specifies:
```css
#bar {
	color: red !important;
}
```

you can ensure that you win by using a more specific selector, like "#foo #bar", "div #bar", "span#bar", etc.

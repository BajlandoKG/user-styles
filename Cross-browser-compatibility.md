User styles are limited to the capabilities of the browser they are installed on. Stylish does not add support for CSS features. In addition, some minor differences with how Stylish applies styles may cause inconsistencies between browsers.

It is highly recommended that you test any user styles you post in both Firefox and Chrome. The vast majority of userstyles.org users use one of these browsers, and supporting both will ensure the maximum number of installs and best ratings. If you don't test with one of these browsers (or test and it doesn't work), then at least say so in your style's description.

To ensure maximum compatibility, consider:
* [Always using !important declarations](Overwriting-page-styles).
* Including both vendor prefixed and standard versions of your properties and values.
